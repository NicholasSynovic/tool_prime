## How To Report

We take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly
disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory
`"Report a Vulnerability"` tab.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After
the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of
the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional
information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.
